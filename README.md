▪ Implement one of the following adversarial search algorithms. (50 points)
• Iterative deepening heuristic alpha-beta search
• Monte Carlo tree search
▪ You need to design your own heuristic evaluation function or playout policy. (20 points)
▪ A time limit (e.g., 10 seconds) for each move is given as an argument of your program. (10 points)
▪ The player (‘White’ or ‘Black’) is given as an argument of your program. (10 points)
▪ The board has 19 × 19 positions. (10 points)
▪ The ‘Black’ player starts a game.
▪ GUI is not necessary. Text-based coordinate I/O, e.g., (J, 10), is allowed.

❑ Submit the source code and documentation.
▪ The documentation should explain
• the search algorithm
• the heuristic evaluation function or playout policy
• how to compile the source code
• how to run the program
• and include video or screen capture of the program execution.
